					p Below are guidelines how to deal with offenses as a moderator, and what to expect as a user.
					p 1. Permanent ban and deletion of offending content.
					p 2. Blatant NSFW is subject to an immediate ban for 1 week or longer. Goonslop is subject to image deletion and a warning or discussion, with a ban of an hour to 1 day to 1 week if the poster does not listen. If a user is making unironic sexually inappropriate text posts, you may give them warnings and ban them for increasingly longer amounts of time.
					p 3. 15 minute ban with a warning, escalate ban times to 30 minutes, then a day, if spam gets out of hand.
					p 4. Permanent ban with a chance to appeal.
					p 5. Deletion of post or removal / redaction of links using Edit. If advertisement is spammed, then punish under the rule for spam.
					p 6. Permanent ban with a chance to appeal.
					.edited
						| If you believe a ban is false, appeal it. If you feel your appeals are
						| wrongly denied reach the Admin by email, see 
						| <a href="/faq.html">faq</a>.
						| #[b However], if your email is nonsense that is the end of it.
						| You may also ask for help in <a href="/q/">/q/</a> regarding your appeal.
